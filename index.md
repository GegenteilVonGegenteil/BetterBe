## User Test Planning
### Heuristic Evaluation
System should generally be easy to use and navigate, due to its minimalistic design. However, the system status isnâ€™t visible, there is no way to prevent errors or recover and no further documentation might leave users alone with their problems.

### Initial Questions
* How simple do the users find the app to be? (DV: Ease of use)
* How do users asses the usability of the app? (DV: Usability/SUS Score)
* What features could be improved or added according to users? (DV: Features to improve/add)

### Methods
* Test subject is given a phone with the app opened.
* Test subject is asked to perform certain scenarios (Add Habit, Mark Habit, Unmark Habit, Edit Habit, Delete Habit) and is then given a SEQ. Test subject is also encouraged to think out loud while performing the tasks.
* After the tasks, participants are given a SUS-Questionaire to fill out.
* Afterwards, a short interview is conducted to assess potential improvements and wishes by test subject.
